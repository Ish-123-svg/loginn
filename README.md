# First Responder System

First Responder System is a web application built in React, compiled by webpack, with a node.js server and a postgresql database. The purpose of FRS is lightning fast communication between users and first responders with geolocation details of users and responders, live updates on situation and response for users and responders, an ongoing log of each implementation of the system and each detail to be saved in a database for eventual machine learning assistance to improve the process further, and a full security plan for disasters, human threats, fire, medical emergencies, and any conceiveable threat to the well-being of the users.

FRS has been deployed as a business-facing application, though there is the potential for expansion to the use of every citizen.
